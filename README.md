This project, developed by Snowi, will be submitted to our instructor, Sir Karl Surdella, for our Application Development and Emerging Technologies subject.

## Getting Started

First, install the package

```

Second, to run the project do the following commands:

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Next JS

I used NEXT.js for this project instead Laravel since I had a experience building a website using this framework.
